# 📁 sample_data

This directory contains small sample files for testing and demonstrating the pipeline components without requiring the full dataset.

## 📄 Files

- `sample_proverbs.json`  
  A small set of 5–10 Yemeni proverbs and their explanations. Useful for testing preprocessing, training, or generation scripts.

- `test_predictions.json`  
  Output predictions generated by the model on a small test set. This file is useful for evaluation and metric testing.

- `train.json` / `val.json`  
  Placeholder references to the full training and validation files, which are expected to be hosted on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). These should **not** be included in the repository, but instructions for downloading them may be provided.

  }
  ```
